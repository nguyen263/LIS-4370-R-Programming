# I was instructed to run the plyr package with the imported assignment and export the files as a table and CSV

# pryr, ISLR, and boot packages are required
# plyr and data.table packages must be loaded
require(pryr)
require(ISLR)
require(boot)
library(data.table)
library(plyr)
# Return the current working directory to continue working on this assignment instead of using setwd()
getwd()
# Assign the imported assignment to student_assignment
# sep = "," - Make R recognize commas as white space
student_assignment <- read.table("Assignment 6 Dataset.txt", header = T, sep = ",")
# To see the data, call "student_assignment"
student_assignment

# The ddply() function comes from the plyr package
# "Sex" was sorted by using transform
# Add a column titled "Average Grade" and list the average grade
studentAvgGrade <- ddply(student_assignment, "Sex", transform, "Average Grade" = mean(Grade))
studentAvgGrade
# The column "Sex" should be assigned to "sex"
sex <- student_assignment$Sex
# Calculate the mean for "Sex"
mean(sex)
# Make a table of studentAvgGrade and add it to the file and give it the title studentAvgGrade
write.table(studentAvgGrade, file = "studentAvgGrade")

# Filter the "Name" of studentAvgGrade containing letter i
# The grepl command returns true or false
# ignore.case = T - ignores uppercase or lowercase
i_students <- subset(studentAvgGrade, grepl("i", studentAvgGrade$Name, ignore.case = T))
i_students
# Make a table and CSV of i_students and add them to the file named i_students
# sep = "," - Separate elements with commas
write.table(i_students, "i_students", sep = ",")
write.csv(i_students, "i_students.csv")

# I am thankful that I learned this plyr package and the functions it contains because I have been using the same libraries since last semester.
# This semester, I hope to learn as many new packages as possible in this class and others.
