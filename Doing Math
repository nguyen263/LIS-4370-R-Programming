# There is a requirement that a matrix must be square, which means that it must have the same number of rows and columns to have determinants.
# Look at matrix A; it has a determinant since both rows and columns have the same number.
# Now, returning to the displayed error message, the reason being that the matrix is not square (aka non-square matrix), that is, it has more columns than rows, as a result, which can result in there being no determinant; this means that no inverse exists.
